# macOS Setup & Tools 
> Welcome to macOS Local Setup & Tools Collection. An ongoing curated list of OS X best applications, libraries, frameworks and tools to help developers set up their macOS Laptop.


![MacOs](https://github.com/exajobs/macOS-tools-collection/blob/main/img/macos-monterey-upgrade.png)

## Motivation

Setting up a new developer machine can be an **ad-hoc, manual, and time-consuming** process.  `dev-setup` aims to **simplify** the process with **easy-to-understand instructions** and **dotfiles/scripts** to **automate the setup** of the following:

* **OS X updates and Xcode Command Line Tools**
* **OS X defaults** geared towards developers
* **Developer tools**: Vim, bash, tab completion, curl, git, GNU core utils, Python, Ruby, etc
* **Developer apps**: iTerm2, Sublime Text, Atom, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, Chrome, etc
* **Python data analysis**: IPython Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc
* **Big Data platforms**: Spark (with IPython Notebook integration) and MapReduce
* **Cloud services**: Amazon Web Services (Boto, AWS CLI, S3cmd, etc) and Heroku
* **Common data stores**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch
* **Javascript web development**: Node.js, JSHint, and Less
* **Android development**: Java, Android SDK, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA

### But...I Don't Need All These Tools!

**`macOS Development Setup` is geared to be more of an organized *reference* of various developer tools.**

**You're *not* meant to install everything.**

If you're interested in automation, `dev-setup` provides a customizable [setup script](#single-setup-script).  There's really no one-size-fits-all solution for developers so you're encouraged to make tweaks to suit your needs.

[Credits](#credits): This repo builds on the awesome work from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) and [Nicolas Hery](https://github.com/nicolashery).

### For Automation, What About Vagrant, Docker, or Boxen?

[Vagrant](#vagrant) and [Docker](#docker) are great tools and are set up by this repo. I've found that Vagrant works well to ensure dev matches up with test and production tiers. I've only started playing around with Docker for side projects and it looks very promising. However, for Mac users, Docker and Vagrant both rely on **virtual machines**, which have their own considerations/pros/cons.

[Boxen](https://boxen.github.com/) is a cool solution, although some might find it better geared towards "more mature companies or devops teams". I've seen some discussions of [difficulties as it is using Puppet under the hood](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/issues/742).

This repo takes a more **light-weight** approach to automation using a combination of **Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, and shell scripts** to do basic system setup.  It also provides **easy-to understand instructions** for installation, configuration, and usage for each developer app or tool.

## Section 1: Installation

### Single Setup Script

#### Running with Git

##### Clone the Repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup.git && cd dev-setup

##### Run the .dots Script with Command Line Arguments

**Since you probably don't want to install every section**, the `.dots` script supports command line arguments to run only specified sections.  Simply pass in the [scripts](#scripts) that you want to install.  Below are some examples.

**For more customization, you can [clone](#clone-the-repo) or [fork](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork) the repo and tweak the `.dots` script and its associated components to suit your needs.**

Run all:

    $ ./.dots all

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`, `pydata.sh`, `aws.sh`, and `datastores.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx pydata aws datastores

#### Running without Git

    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/master/.dots && ./.dots [Add ARGS Here]

#### Scripts

* [.dots](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots)
    * Runs specified scripts
* [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/bootstrap.sh)
    * Syncs dev-setup to your local home directory `~`
* [osxprep.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osxprep.sh)
    * Updates OS X and installs Xcode command line tools
* [brew.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh)
    * Installs common Homebrew formulae and apps
* [osx.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh)
    * Sets up OS X defaults geared towards developers
* [pydata.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/pydata.sh)
    * Sets up python for data analysis
* [aws.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/aws.sh)

* [datastores.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/datastores.sh)
    * Sets up common data stores
* [web.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/web.sh)
    * Sets up JavaScript web development
* [android.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/android.sh)
    * Sets up Android development

**Notes:**

* `.dots` will initially prompt you to enter your password.
* `.dots` might ask you to re-enter your password at certain stages of the installation.
* If OS X updates require a restart, simply run `.dots` again to resume where you left off.
* When installing the Xcode command line tools, a dialog box will confirm installation.
    * Once Xcode is installed, follow the instructions on the terminal to continue.
* `.dots` runs `brew.sh`, which takes awhile to complete as some formulae need to be installed from source.
* **When `.dots` completes, be sure to restart your computer for all updates to take effect.**

I encourage you to read through Section 1 so you have a better idea of what each installation script does.  The following discussions describe in greater detail what is executed when running the [.dots](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots) script.

### bootstrap.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/commands.png">
  <br/>
</p>

The `bootstrap.sh` script will sync the dev-setup repo to your local home directory.  This will include customizations for Vim, bash, curl, git, tab completion, aliases, a number of utility functions, etc.  Section 2 of this repo describes some of the customizations.

#### Running with Git

First, fork or [clone the repo](#clone-the-repo).  The `bootstrap.sh` script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder `~`:

    $ source bootstrap.sh

To update later on, just run that command again.

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

    $ set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh

#### Running without Git

To sync dev-setup to your local home directory without Git, run the following:

    $ cd ~; curl -#L https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,LICENSE}

To update later on, just run that command again.

#### Optional: Specify PATH

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files before any feature testing (such as detecting which version of `ls` is being used takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Optional: Add Custom Commands

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Donne Martin"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="donne.martin@gmail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"

# Pip should only run if there is a virtualenv currently activated
export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true

# Install or upgrade a global package
# Usage: gpip install –upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv
gpip(){
   PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="" pip "$@"
}
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions, and aliases from the dev-setup repository, although it’s probably better to [fork the dev-setup repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork).

### osxprep.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/xcode.jpg">
  <br/>
</p>

Run the `osxprep.sh` script:

    $ ./osxprep.sh

`osxprep.sh` will first install all updates.  If a restart is required, simply run the script again.  Once all updates are installed, `osxprep.sh` will then [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools).

If you want to go the manual route, you can also install all updates by running "App Store", selecting the "Updates" icon, then updating both the OS and installed apps.

#### Install Xcode Command Line Tools

An important dependency before many tools such as Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Tools for Xcode**. These include compilers like gcc that will allow you to build from source.

If you are running **OS X 10.9 Mavericks or later**, then you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools directly from the command line with:

    $ xcode-select --install

**Note**: the `osxprep.sh` script executes this command.

Running the command above will display a dialog where you can either:
* Install Xcode and the command line tools
* Install the command line tools only
* Cancel the install

##### OS X 10.8 and Older

If you're running 10.8 or older, you'll need to go to [http://developer.apple.com/downloads](http://developer.apple.com/downloads), and sign in with your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases). Unfortunately, you're greeted by a rather annoying questionnaire. All questions are required, so feel free to answer at random.

Once you reach the downloads page, search for "command line tools", and download the latest **Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode**. Open the **.dmg** file once it's done downloading, and double-click on the **.mpkg** installer to launch the installation. When it's done, you can unmount the disk in Finder.

### brew.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew2.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager that simplifies installing and updating applications or libraries.

Some of the apps installed by the `brew.sh` script include: Chrome, Firefox, Sublime Text, Atom, Dropbox, Evernote, Skype, Slack, Alfred, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, etc.  **For a full listing of installed formulae and apps, refer to the commented [brew.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh) directly and tweak it to suit your needs.**

Run the `brew.sh` script:

    $ ./brew.sh

The `brew.sh` script takes awhile to complete, as some formulae need to be installed from source.

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal**

### osx.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/osx.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set OS X defaults geared towards developers.  The `osx.sh` script also configures common third-party apps such Sublime Text and Chrome.

**Note**: **I strongly encourage you read through the commented [osx.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh) and tweak any settings based on your personal preferences.  The script defaults are intended for you to customize.**  For example, if you are not running an SSD you might want to change some of the settings listed in the SSD section.

Run the `osx.sh` script:

    $ ./osx.sh

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal.**

### pydata.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/pydata.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a development environment to work with Python and data analysis without relying on the more heavyweight [Anaconda](#anaconda) distribution, run the `pydata.sh` script:

    $ ./pydata.sh

This will install [Virtualenv](#virtualenv) and [Virtualenvwrapper](#virtualenvwrapper).  It will then set up two virtual environments loaded with the packages you will need to work with data in Python 2 and Python 3.

To switch to the Python 2 virtual environment, run the following Virtualenvwrapper command:

    $ workon py2-data

To switch to the Python 3 virtual environment, run the following Virtualenvwrapper command:

    $ workon py3-data

Then start working with the installed packages, for example:

    $ ipython notebook

[Section 3: Python Data Analysis](#section-3-python-data-analysis) describes the installed packages and usage.

### aws.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a development environment to work with Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and Amazon Web Services, run the `aws.sh` script:

    $ ./aws.sh

[Section 4: Big Data, AWS, and Heroku](#section-4-big-data-aws-and-heroku) describes the installed packages and usage.

### datastores.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/datastores.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up common data stores, run the `datastores.sh` script:

    $ ./datastores.sh

[Section 5: Data Stores](#section-5-data-stores) describes the installed packages and usage.

### web.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/webdev.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a JavaScript web development environment, Run the `web.sh` script:

    $ ./web.sh

[Section 6: Web Development](#section-6-web-development) describes the installed packages and usage.

### android.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/android.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up an Android development environment, run the `android.sh` script:

    $ ./android.sh

[Section 7: Android Development](#section-7-android-development) describes the installed packages and usage.

## Section 2: General Apps and Tools

### Sublime Text

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/sublime.png">
  <br/>
</p>

With the terminal, the text editor is a developer's most important tool. Everyone has their preferences, but unless you're a hardcore [Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) user, a lot of people are going to tell you that [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is currently the best one out there.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Sublime Text.

If you prefer to install it separately, go ahead and [download](http://www.sublimetext.com/) it. Open the **.dmg** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder.

**Note**: At this point I'm going to create a shortcut on the OS X Dock for both for Sublime Text. To do so, right-click on the running application and select **Options > Keep in Dock**.

Sublime Text is not free, but I think it has an unlimited "evaluation period". Anyhow, we're going to be using it so much that even the seemingly expensive $70 price tag is worth every penny. If you can afford it, I suggest you [support](http://www.sublimetext.com/buy) this awesome tool.

#### Configuration

The [osx.sh script](#osxsh-script) contains Sublime Text configurations.

#### Soda Theme

The [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) is a great UI theme for Sublime Text, especially if you use a dark theme and think the side bar sticks out like a sore thumb.

##### Installation with Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Soda Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Soda Theme package is listed as `Theme - Soda` in the packages list.

##### Installation with Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    $ git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Soda"

##### Activating the Theme on Sublime Text 2

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 2 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"
    }

##### Activating the Theme on Sublime Text 3

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light 3.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark 3.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 3 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light 3.sublime-theme"
    }

##### Changing Monokai Comment Color

Although Monokai is a great color scheme, I find that comments can be difficult to see.  You can follow these [instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32686509) to change the color of the default theme.

I set my comments color to `#E6DB74`.

```
<dict>
    ...
    <dict>
        <key>foreground</key>
        <string>#E6DB74</string>
    </dict>
    ...
</dict>
```

### Atom

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/atom.png">
  <br/>
</p>

[Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) is a great open-source editor from GitHub that is rapidly gaining contributors and popularity.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Atom.

If you prefer to install it separately, [download](https://atom.io/) it, open the **.dmg** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder.

#### Configuration

Atom has a great package manager that allows you to easily install both core and community packages.

### Terminal Customization

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/terminal.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Since we spend so much time in the terminal, we should try to make it a more pleasant and colorful place.

#### Configuration

The [bootstrap.sh script](#bootstrapsh-script) and [osx.sh script](#osxsh-script) contain terminal customizations.

### iTerm2

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/iterm2.png">
  <br/>
</p>

I prefer iTerm2 over the stock Terminal, as it has some additional [great features](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html). Download and install iTerm2 (the newest version, even if it says "beta release").

In Finder, drag and drop the iTerm Application file into the Applications folder.

You can now launch iTerm, through the Launchpad for instance.

Let's just quickly change some preferences. In iTerm > Preferences..., in the tab Profiles, create a new one with the "+" icon, and rename it to your first name for example. Then, select Other Actions... > Set as Default. Under the section Window, change the size to something better, like Columns: 125 and Rows: 35.  I also like to set General > Working Directory > Reuse previous session's directory.  Finally, I change the way the option key works so that I can quickly jump between words as described [here](https://coderwall.com/p/h6yfda/use-and-to-jump-forwards-backwards-words-in-iterm-2-on-os-x).

When done, hit the red "X" in the upper left (saving is automatic in OS X preference panes). Close the window and open a new one to see the size change.

#### Configuration

Since we spend so much time in the terminal, we should try to make it a more pleasant and colorful place. What follows might seem like a lot of work, but trust me, it'll make the development experience so much better.

Now let's add some color. I'm a big fan of the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme. It is supposed to be scientifically optimal for the eyes. I just find it pretty.

- In **iTerm2 Preferences**, under **Profiles** and **Colors**, go to **Load Presets...** and select **Solarized Dark** to activate it. Voila!

At this point you can also change your computer's name, which shows up in this terminal prompt. If you want to do so, go to **System Preferences** > **Sharing**. For example, I changed mine from "Donne's MacBook Pro" to just "MacBook Pro", so it shows up as `MacBook-Pro` in the terminal.

Now we have a terminal we can work with!

### Vim

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/vim.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Although Sublime Text will be our main editor, it is a good idea to learn some very basic usage of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). It is a very popular text editor inside the terminal, and is usually pre-installed on any Unix system.

For example, when you run a Git commit, it will open Vim to allow you to type the commit message.

I suggest you read a tutorial on Vim. Grasping the concept of the two "modes" of the editor, **Insert** (by pressing `i`) and **Normal** (by pressing `Esc` to exit Insert mode), will be the part that feels most unnatural. After that it's just remembering a few important keys.

#### Configuration

The [bootstrap.sh script](#bootstrapsh-script) contains Vim customizations.

### VirtualBox

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/virtualbox.png">
  <br/>
</p>

VirtualBox creates and manages virtual machines.  It's a solid free solution to its commercial rival VMware.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs VirtualBox

If you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" virtualbox

### Vagrant

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/vagrant.jpeg">
  <br/>
</p>

Vagrant creates and configures development environments.  You can think of it as a higher-level wrapper around VirtualBox and configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and Salt.  Vagrant also supports Docker containers and server environments like Amazon EC2.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Vagrant.

If you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" vagrant

### Docker

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/docker.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Docker automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.  I think the following [quote](http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/cloud-computing/731454-docker-a-shipping-container-for-linux-code) explains docker nicely: "Docker is a tool that can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This helps enable flexibility and portability on where the application can run, whether on premise, public cloud, private cloud, bare metal, etc".

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Docker.

If you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/) or run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install docker
    $ brew install boot2docker

#### Configuration

Initialize and start `boot2docker` (only need to do this once):

    $ boot2docker init

Start the VM:

    $ boot2docker up

Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable and fill in IP and PORT based on the output from the `boot2coker up` command:

### Git

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/git.png">
  <br/>
</p>

What's a developer without [Git](http://git-scm.com/)?

#### Installation

Git should have been installed when you ran through the [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools) section.

#### Configuration

To check your version of Git, run the following command:

    $ git --version

And `$ which git` should output `/usr/local/bin/git`.

Let's set up some basic configuration. Download the [.gitconfig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/master/.gitconfig) file to your home directory:

    $ cd ~
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/master/.gitconfig

It will add some color to the `status`, `branch`, and `diff` Git commands, as well as a couple aliases. Feel free to take a look at the contents of the file, and add to it to your liking.

Next, we'll define your Git user (should be the same name and email you use for [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)):

    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
    $ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

They will get added to your `.gitconfig` file.

To push code to your GitHub repositories, we're going to use the recommended HTTPS method (versus SSH). So you don't have to type your username and password everytime, let's enable Git password caching as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git):

    $ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

**Note**: On a Mac, it is important to remember to add `.DS_Store` (a hidden OS X system file that's put in folders) to your `.gitignore` files. You can take a look at this repository's [.gitignore](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.gitignore) file for inspiration.  Also check out GitHub's [collection of .gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

### Homebrew

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Package managers make it so much easier to install and update applications (for Operating Systems) or libraries (for programming languages). The most popular one for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Homebrew and a number of useful Homebrew formulae and apps.

If you prefer to install it separately, run the following command and follow the steps on the screen:

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

#### Usage

To install a package (or **Formula** in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:

    $ brew install <formula>

To update Homebrew's directory of formulae, run:

    $ brew update

**Note**: I've seen that command fail sometimes because of a bug. If that ever happens, run the following (when you have Git installed):

    $ cd /usr/local
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git reset --hard origin/master

To see if any of your packages need to be updated:

    $ brew outdated

To update a package:

    $ brew upgrade <formula>

Homebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to roll back. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

    $ brew cleanup

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

    $ brew list --versions

### Ruby and rbenv

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/ruby.png">
  <br/>
</p>

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) is already installed on Unix systems, but we don't want to mess around with that installation. More importantly, we want to be able to use the latest version of Ruby.

#### Installation

`brew.sh` provides [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) which allow you to manage multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine.  `brew.sh` adds the following line to your `.extra` file to initialize `rbenv`:

```
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

#### Usage

`rbenv` uses `ruby-build` to download, compile, and install new versions of Ruby. You can see all versions available to download and install:

```
$ ruby-build --definitions
```

To install a new version of Ruby:

```
# list all available versions installed on the system:
$ rbenv install -l

# install a Ruby version:
$ rbenv install 2.2.3
```

To switch Ruby versions:

```
# set a local application-specific Ruby version in the current directory
$ rbenv local 1.9.3

# set the global version of Ruby to be used in all shells
$ rbenv global 2.0.0

```

`rbenv` by default will install Ruby versions into a directory of the same name under `~/.rbenv/versions`. Because your user owns this directory, you no longer need to use `sudo` to install gems.

### Python

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/python.png">
  <br/>
</p>

OS X, like Linux, ships with [Python](http://python.org/) already installed. But you don't want to mess with the system Python (some system tools rely on it, etc.), so we'll install our own version with Homebrew. It will also allow us to get the very latest version of Python 2.7 and Python 3.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs the latest versions of Python 2 and Python 3.

### Pip

[Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) is the Python package manager.

#### Installation

The [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script) installs pip.

#### Usage

Here are a couple Pip commands to get you started. To install a Python package:

    $ pip install <package>

To upgrade a package:

    $ pip install --upgrade <package>

To see what's installed:

    $ pip freeze

To uninstall a package:

    $ pip uninstall <package>

### Virtualenv

[Virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) is a tool that creates an isolated Python environment for each of your projects. For a particular project, instead of installing required packages globally, it is best to install them in an isolated folder in the project (say a folder named `venv`), that will be managed by virtualenv.

The advantage is that different projects might require different versions of packages, and it would be hard to manage that if you install packages globally. It also allows you to keep your global `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` folder clean.

#### Installation

The [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script) installs Virtualenv.

#### Usage

Let's say you have a project in a directory called `myproject`. To set up virtualenv for that project:

    $ cd myproject/
    $ virtualenv venv --distribute

If you want your virtualenv to also inherit globally installed packages (like IPython or Numpy mentioned above), use:

    $ virtualenv venv --distribute --system-site-packages

These commands create a `venv` subdirectory in your project where everything is installed. You need to **activate** it first though (in every terminal where you are working on your project):

    $ source venv/bin/activate

You should see a `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt indicating that you are working inside the virtualenv. Now when you install something:

    $ pip install <package>

It will get installed in the `venv` folder, and not conflict with other projects.

**Important**: Remember to add `venv` to your project's `.gitignore` file so you don't include all of that in your source code!

### Virtualenvwrapper

[Virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a set of extensions that includes wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies.

Main features include:

* Organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.
* Wrappers for managing your virtual environments (create, delete, copy).
* Use a single command to switch between environments.
* Tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as argument.

#### Installation

The [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script) installs Virtualenvwrapper.

#### Usage

Create a new virtual environment. When you create a new environment it automatically becomes the active environment:

    $ mkvirtualenv [env name]

Remove an existing virtual environment. The environment must be deactivated (see below) before it can be removed:

    $ rmvirtualenv [env name]

Activate a virtual environment. Will also list all existing virtual environments if no argument is passed:

    $ workon [env name]

Deactivate the currently active virtual environment. Note that workonwill automatically deactivate the current environment before activating a new one:

    $ deactivate

### AWS Account

To start using AWS, you first need to sign up for an account.

#### Sign up for AWS

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS. You are charged only for the services that you use.  New users are eligible for 12 months of usage through the [AWS Free Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/).

To create an AWS account, open http://aws.amazon.com/, and then click Sign Up.  Follow the on-screen instructions.  Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.  Note your AWS account ID.

### Boto

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/boto.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Boto is the official AWS SDK for Python.

#### Installation

The [aws.sh script](#aws-script) installs boto.  If you prefer to install it separately, run:

    $ pip install boto

Boto uses the same configuration as described in the [AWS CLI](#aws-cli) section.

#### Usage

Refer to the following [Boto IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).

### S3cmd

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/s3cmd.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Before I discovered [S3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd), I had been using the [S3 console](http://aws.amazon.com/console/) to do basic operations and [boto](https://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to do more of the heavy lifting.  However, sometimes I just want to hack away at a command line to do my work.

I've found S3cmd to be a great command line tool for interacting with S3 on AWS.  S3cmd is written in Python, is open source, and is free even for commercial use.  It offers more advanced features than those found in the [AWS CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

#### Installation

**S3cmd is Python 2 only.**

The [aws.sh script](#aws-script) installs s3cmd.  If you prefer to install it separately, run:

    $ pip install s3cmd

Running the following command will prompt you to enter your AWS access and AWS secret keys. To follow security best practices, make sure you are using an IAM account as opposed to using the root account.

I also suggest enabling GPG encryption which will encrypt your data at rest, and enabling HTTPS to encrypt your data in transit. Note this might impact performance.

    $ s3cmd --configure

Alternatively, the aws.sh script also syncs the template ```.s3cfg``` file to your home folder.  Note running the aws.sh script will overwrite any existing ```~/.s3cfg``` file.  Update the config file with your credentials and location:

```
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOURSECRETKEY
...
bucket_location = US
...
gpg_passphrase = YOURPASSPHRASE
```

**Be careful you do not accidentally check in your credentials.**  The .gitignore file is set to ignore files with credentials.

#### Usage

Refer to the following [s3cmd IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).

### Heroku

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/heroku.jpg">
  <br/>
</p>

[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), if you're not already familiar with it, is a [Platform-as-a-Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) that makes it really easy to deploy your apps online. There are other similar solutions out there, but Heroku was among the first and is currently the most popular. Not only does it make a developer's life easier, but I find that having Heroku deployment in mind when building an app forces you to follow modern app development [best practices](http://www.12factor.net/).

#### Installation

Assuming that you have an account (sign up if you don't), let's install the [Heroku Client](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-the-cli) for the command-line. Heroku offers a Mac OS X installer, the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), that includes the client. But for these kind of tools, I prefer using Homebrew. It allows us to keep better track of what we have installed. Luckily for us, Homebrew includes a `heroku-toolbelt` formula:

    $ brew install heroku-toolbelt

The formula might not have the latest version of the Heroku Client, which is updated pretty often. Let's update it now:

    $ brew upgrade heroku-toolbelt

Don't be afraid to run `heroku update` every now and then to always have the most recent version.

#### Usage

Login to your Heroku account using your email and password:

    $ heroku login

If this is a new account, and since you don't already have a public **SSH key** in your `~/.ssh` directory, it will offer to create one for you. Say yes! It will also upload the key to your Heroku account, which will allow you to deploy apps from this computer.

If it didn't offer create the SSH key for you (i.e. your Heroku account already has SSH keys associated with it), you can do so manually by running:

     $ mkdir ~/.ssh
     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Keep the default file name and skip the passphrase by just hitting Enter both times. Then, add the key to your Heroku account:

    $ heroku keys:add

Once the key business is done, you're ready to deploy apps! Heroku has a great [Getting Started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python) guide, so I'll let you refer to that (the one linked here is for Python, but there is one for every popular language). Heroku uses Git to push code for deployment, so make sure your app is under Git version control. A quick cheat sheet (if you've used Heroku before):

    $ cd myapp/
    $ heroku create myapp
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku ps
    $ heroku logs -t

The [Heroku Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) is full of great resources, so be sure to check it out!

## Section 5: Data Stores

### MySQL

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/mysql.png">
  <br/>
</p>

#### Installation

The [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs MySQL.  If you prefer to install it separately, run:

    $ brew update # Always good to do
    $ brew install mysql

As you can see in the ouput from Homebrew, before we can use MySQL we first need to set it up with:

    $ unset TMPDIR
    $ mkdir /usr/local/var
    $ mysql_install_db --verbose --user=`whoami` --basedir="$(brew --prefix mysql)" --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp

#### Usage

To start the MySQL server, use the `mysql.server` tool:

    $ mysql.server start

To stop it when you are done, run:

    $ mysql.server stop

You can see the different commands available for `mysql.server` with:

    $ mysql.server --help

To connect with the command-line client, run:

    $ mysql -uroot

(Use `exit` to quit the MySQL shell.)

**Note**: By default, the MySQL user `root` has no password. It doesn't really matter for a local development database. If you wish to change it though, you can use `$ mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'`.

### MySQL Workbench

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/mysql_workbench.png">
  <br/>
</p>

In terms of a GUI client for MySQL, I'm used to the official and free [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). But feel free to use whichever you prefer.

#### Installation

The [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs MySQL Workbench.  If you prefer to install it separately, run:

    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" mysqlworkbench

You can also find the MySQL Workbench download [here](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/). (**Note**: It will ask you to sign in, you don't need to, just click on "No thanks, just start my download!" at the bottom.)

### MongoDB

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/mongodb.jpeg">
  <br/>
</p>

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is a popular [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database.

#### Installation

The [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs MongoDB. If you prefer to install it separately, run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install mongo

#### Usage

In a terminal, start the MongoDB server:

    $ mongod

In another terminal, connect to the database with the Mongo shell using:

    $ mongo

I'll let you refer to MongoDB's [Getting Started](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) guide for more!

### Redis

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/redis.png">
  <br/>
</p>

[Redis](http://redis.io/) is a blazing fast, in-memory, key-value store, that uses the disk for persistence. It's kind of like a NoSQL database, but there are a lot of [cool things](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html) that you can do with it that would be hard or inefficient with other database solutions. For example, it's often used as session management or caching by web apps, but it has many other uses.

#### Installation

The [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs Redis. If you prefer to install it separately, run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install redis

#### Usage

Start a local Redis server using the default configuration settings with:

    $ redis-server

For advanced usage, you can tweak the configuration file at `/usr/local/etc/redis.conf` (I suggest making a backup first), and use those settings with:

    $ redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

In another terminal, connect to the server with the Redis command-line interface using:

    $ redis-cli

I'll let you refer to Redis' [documentation](http://redis.io/documentation) or other tutorials for more information.

### Elasticsearch

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/elasticsearch.png">
  <br/>
</p>

As it says on the box, [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) is a "powerful open source, distributed real-time search and analytics engine". It uses an HTTP REST API, making it really easy to work with from any programming language.

You can use elasticsearch for such cool things as real-time search results, autocomplete, recommendations, machine learning, and more.

#### Installation

The [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs Elasticsearch.  If you prefer to install it separately, check out the following discussion.

Elasticsearch runs on Java, so check if you have it installed by running:

    $ java -version

If Java isn't installed yet, a window will appear prompting you to install it. Go ahead and click "Install".

Next, install elasticsearch with:

    $ brew install elasticsearch

**Note**: Elasticsearch also has a `plugin` program that gets moved to your `PATH`. I find that too generic of a name, so I rename it to `elasticsearch-plugin` by running (will need to do that again if you update elasticsearch):

    $ mv /usr/local/bin/plugin /usr/local/bin/elasticsearch-plugin

Below I will use `elasticsearch-plugin`, just replace it with `plugin` if you haven't followed this step.

As you guessed, you can add plugins to elasticsearch. A popular one is [elasticsearch-head](http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/), which gives you a web interface to the REST API. Install it with:

    $ elasticsearch-plugin --install mobz/elasticsearch-head

### Usage

Start a local elasticsearch server with:

    $ elasticsearch

Test that the server is working correctly by running:

    $ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/'

If you installed the elasticsearch-head plugin, you can visit its interface at `http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/`.

Elasticsearch's [documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/) is more of a reference. To get started, I suggest reading some of the blog posts linked on this [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11593035/beginners-guide-to-elasticsearch/11767610#11767610).

## Section 6: Web Development

### Node.js

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/nodejs.png">
  <br/>
</p>

#### Installation

The [web.sh script](#websh-script) installs [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  You can also install it manually with Homebrew:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install node

The formula also installs the [npm](https://npmjs.org/) package manager. However, as suggested by the Homebrew output, we need to add `/usr/local/share/npm/bin` to our path so that npm-installed modules with executables will have them picked up.

To do so, add this line to your `~/.path` file, before the `export PATH` line:

```bash
PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH
```

Open a new terminal for the `$PATH` changes to take effect.

We also need to tell npm where to find the Xcode Command Line Tools, by running:

    $ sudo xcode-select -switch /usr/bin

(If Xcode Command Line Tools were installed by Xcode, try instead:)

    $ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

Node modules are installed locally in the `node_modules` folder of each project by default, but there are at least two that are worth installing globally. Those are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

    $ npm install -g coffee-script
    $ npm install -g grunt-cli

#### Npm usage

To install a package:

    $ npm install <package> # Install locally
    $ npm install -g <package> # Install globally

To install a package and save it in your project's `package.json` file:

    $ npm install <package> --save

To see what's installed:

    $ npm list # Local
    $ npm list -g # Global

To find outdated packages (locally or globally):

    $ npm outdated [-g]

To upgrade all or a particular package:

    $ npm update [<package>]

To uninstall a package:

    $ npm uninstall <package>

### JSHint

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/jshint.png">
  <br/>
</p>

JSHint is a JavaScript developer's best friend.

If the extra credit assignment to install Sublime Package Manager was completed, JSHint can be run as part of Sublime Text.

#### Installation

The [web.sh script](#websh-script) installs JSHint.  You can also install it manually via via npm:

    $ npm install -g jshint

Follow additional instructions on the [JSHint Package Manager page](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/JSHint) or [build it manually](https://github.com/jshint/jshint).

### LESS

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/less.png">
  <br/>
</p>

CSS preprocessors are becoming quite popular, the most popular processors are [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com). Preprocessing is a lot like compiling code for CSS. It allows you to reuse CSS in many different ways. Let's start out with using LESS as a basic preprocessor, it's used by a lot of popular CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

#### Installation

The [web.sh script](#websh-script) installs LESS.  To install LESS manually you have to use NPM / Node, which you installed earlier using Homebrew. In the terminal use:

    $ npm install -g less

Note: the `-g` flag is optional but it prevents having to mess around with file paths. You can install without the flag, just know what you're doing.

You can check that it installed properly by using:

    $ lessc --version

This should output some information about the compiler:

    lessc 1.5.1 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]

Okay, LESS is installed and running. Great!

#### Usage

There's a lot of different ways to use LESS. Generally I use it to compile my stylesheet locally. You can do that by using this command in the terminal:

    $ lessc template.less template.css

The two options are the "input" and "output" files for the compiler. The command looks in the current directory for the LESS stylesheet, compiles it, and outputs it to the second file in the same directory. You can add in paths to keep your project files organized:

    $ lessc less/template.less css/template.css

Read more about LESS on their page here: http://lesscss.org/
